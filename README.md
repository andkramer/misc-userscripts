## steamautoredeem.js

When trying to redeem a steam key via [Steam Store Key Registration][0] this automatically accepts the steam subscriber agreement and redeems the key. The Tab is closed after a successful registration and kept open if the registration fails.

This can as an example easily be used to redeem multiple humble bundle keys from the humble bundle key page, if you have many unredeemed keys, like i had.
